# TODOs for Claude Code

## ✅ COMPLETED: Combine Garden Tasks and Calendar

- ✅ Replace Garden Tasks with the Calendar, and incorporate task information into the calendar
- ✅ For non-recurring calendar items, let me dismiss the item once it's done.
- ✅ For recurring calendar items (like watering), let me mark them as done so you'll remind me when to do them again.
- ✅ This involves refreshing the interface async without user input!

## ✅ COMPLETED: Move the calendar to the dashboard

## Incorporate current weather and forecast data async

## Plan a system that allows for cross-session persistence

Right now, the application is based entirely on browser storage. What would it take to add authenticated users (via some existing SSO provider e.g. Google or Github)?

## Rethink settings

- Eliminate the settings page. 
- Allow settings on the dashboard and analysis pages.
- Reduce the visual footprint of climate options and strategy options.## Is there further modularization/componentization we should do?

## I should be able to say "yes, I will do this thing" on the calendar, and it should offer to generate a shopping item.

## Is there an easy-ish way to make sure only the garden creator can edit the garden?



# evergreen todos

## Does the design system need any updates?

## Eliminate unused code

## Review navigation styling

## Does the CSS need to be refactored into modules, or is it fine as is?

## Eliminate duplicate / unnecessary CSS
