The file `claude_todo` contains a collection of tasks. I will refer you to a specific task within this file. If I don't refer to a specific feature in this file, tackle the first uncompleted task, as indicated by an h2.

For each item under a task, create a plan, let me review the plan, and then, if I approve, implement the plan incrementally, with tests. Commit incrementally as well.

*Always forecast the cost of implementing the plan with Claude Code* before executing the plan.

When you've completed a task and committed the results, delete any files and functions that are no longer used, mark the task as `COMPLETE` in the todo file, and commit.

If instructions are unclear, ask clarifying questions.
