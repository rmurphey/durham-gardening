# Red Sails Lettuce
*Primary Cool-Season Crop with Limited Heat Tolerance*

## Variety Details
- **Type:** Loose-leaf lettuce with red-tinged leaves
- **Days to maturity:** 45-55 days to full head, 25-35 days for baby greens
- **Climate reality:** "Heat-tolerant" is relative - still struggles above 85°F
- **Appearance:** Green leaves with red edges, very attractive
- **Best seasons:** October-April for consistent production

## Heat-Adapted Planting Strategy
- **PRIMARY SEASONS:** October-March (peak productivity)
- **Secondary:** April & September (transition periods)
- **Summer survival:** June-August only with shade cloth + extra care
- **Where:** Morning sun areas, containers for mobility
- **Spacing:** 6-8 inches apart for succession harvests, 4 inches for baby greens
- **Depth:** ¼ inch deep (barely cover seeds)
- **Soil:** Well-draining, enriched with cheap compost ($10/40lb)

## Seasonal Care Strategy
### **Cool Season Production (Oct-Mar)**
- **Water:** Drip irrigation 2-3x/week, consistent moisture
- **Fertilizer:** Monthly compost application, thrives in cool weather
- **Protection:** Row covers only for hard freezes
- **Succession:** Plant every 2-3 weeks for continuous harvest

### **Heat Survival Mode (Jun-Aug)**
- **Only if:** You have shade cloth and are committed to extra care
- **Water:** Daily drip irrigation, morning watering only
- **Fertilizer:** Minimal - heat-stressed plants can't process nutrients
- **Reality check:** Often not worth the water/effort vs. cool season yields

## Optimized Growing Methods
- **Baby greens focus:** Faster harvest, less heat stress risk
- **Cut-and-come-again:** Best method for continuous cool-season harvest
- **Container growing:** Mobility for seasonal management

## Revised Succession Schedule
- **Fall peak:** October, November, December (best production)
- **Winter:** January, February (warm winter advantage)
- **Spring:** March, early April (before heat builds)
- **Summer:** Skip unless committed to shade infrastructure
- **Interval:** Every 2 weeks during peak season for continuous harvest

## Harvest & Economics
- **Baby greens:** 25-35 days, premium grocery value ($4-6/lb vs. $0.50/packet)
- **Cut-and-come-again:** Multiple harvests from single planting
- **Best time:** Early morning when leaves are crisp and sweet
- **Storage:** Use within 2-3 days; continuous harvest eliminates storage needs
- **ROI:** Excellent return during cool seasons, poor return in summer heat

## Problem Management
- **Bolting:** Rare problem during cool seasons vs. inevitable in summer
- **Bitter leaves:** Avoided entirely with cool-season focus
- **Pests:** Fewer issues during cool weather
- **Value focus:** Don't waste effort on stressed summer crops

## Value-Focused Space Planning
- **Peak season allocation:** 6-8 sq ft for continuous succession
- **Container strategy:** Mobility for optimal light management
- **Companion plants:** Cool-season herbs, radishes, carrots
- **Economic reality:** Focus space/effort on productive seasons only
