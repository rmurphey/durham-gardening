# Blue Lake Bush Beans (Bush Bean 274)
*Heat-Adapted Cool Season Focus*

## Variety Details
- **Type:** Bush bean, determinate
- **Days to maturity:** 50-60 days
- **Packet size:** 4 oz (enough for multiple plantings)
- **Climate note:** Traditional summer crop, now grown in cooler months to avoid extreme heat

## Heat-Adapted Planting Schedule
- **PRIMARY SEASON:** September-November & February-April (cool weather focus)
- **Summer growing:** Possible with shade cloth protection but not recommended
- **Where:** Any main bed with morning sun, afternoon shade in summer
- **Spacing:** 4-6 inches apart in rows, 18 inches between rows
- **Depth:** 1-2 inches deep
- **Soil temp:** 60-75°F optimal (avoid 90°F+ soil temperatures)

## Seasonal Care Strategy
### **Cool Season Growing (Sept-Nov, Feb-Apr)**
- **Water:** Drip irrigation preferred, deep watering 2x/week
- **Fertilizer:** Light compost ($10/40lb bag) - beans fix their own nitrogen
- **Protection:** Row covers for unexpected cold snaps only

### **Summer Survival Growing (June-Aug)** 
- **Only if:** Using 50% shade cloth and extra water
- **Water:** Daily drip irrigation during heat waves
- **Fertilizer:** Minimal - plants stressed, avoid overfeeding
- **Reality check:** Not economical given water/effort vs. yield

## Revised Succession Schedule
- **Fall primary:** September, early October (best yields)
- **Winter:** November (warm winter harvest)
- **Spring primary:** February, March (before heat builds)
- **Summer:** Skip unless you have reliable shade infrastructure

## Harvest & Storage
- **When:** Pick when pods are tender but seeds haven't fully developed
- **Frequency:** Harvest every 2-3 days during peak season
- **Storage:** Use fresh within a few days; blanch and freeze for longer storage
- **Yield:** 2-3 weeks of harvesting per cool-season planting (longer than stressed summer crops)

## Heat-Adapted Problem Solving
- **Heat stress:** Plants flower but don't set pods above 85°F
- **Pests:** Fewer issues during cool seasons vs. summer stress periods
- **Diseases:** Drip irrigation prevents most fungal problems
- **Economics:** Cool season yields justify space; summer yields often don't

## Value-Focused Space Planning
- **Bed allocation:** 10-15 sq ft per succession (prioritize cool season plantings)
- **Companion plants:** Carrots, cool-season herbs, nasturtiums
- **Rotation:** Follow beans with heavy feeders (okra, peppers) that use residual nitrogen
- **ROI:** Focus effort on September-March plantings for best return on space/water
