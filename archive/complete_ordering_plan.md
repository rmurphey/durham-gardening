### If You Can't Find an Item:

- Browse categories: Seeds → Vegetables → [specific type]
- Check spelling variations
- Contact customer service if item seems unavailable

### Alternative Search Terms:
- "Pak Choi" = "Bok Choy"
- "Nasturtium" may be under Flowers category
- "Microgreens" has its own category

### If Items Are Out of Stock:
- Harris Model Parsnip → try "All American Parsnip"
- German Winter Thyme → try regular "Thyme"
- Any unavailable variety → choose similar from same vegetable family
