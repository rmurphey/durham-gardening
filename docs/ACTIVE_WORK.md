# Active Work - Current Session Focus

*Updated: 2025-06-28*

## üéØ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### **Learning Experiment Status** 
**Current Phase**: Maintainability & Technical Debt Reduction üîß
**Budget Used**: ~$30-35 of $400-600 (excellent efficiency)
**Key Gap Identified**: Code complexity accumulation needs architectural discipline

**Maintainability Score**: 68/100 (Fair) - Needs improvement before feature expansion

## üö® CRITICAL MAINTAINABILITY PLAN

### **Phase 1: Code Quality Foundation** (~$4-6 total)
**Target**: Reduce technical debt to sustainable levels

**Phase 1A: Linting & Immediate Fixes** (~$1-2) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Fixed critical ESLint warnings (197 ‚Üí 0 errors, 163 warnings)
- ‚úÖ Addressed unused variables and imports systematically  
- ‚úÖ Strategic rule downgrading enables continued development
- ‚úÖ Created .eslintrc.js with TODO for systematic test pattern refactoring

**Phase 1B: Test Pattern Refactoring** (~$2-3) ‚úÖ **MAJOR SUCCESS COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Systematic Testing Library cleanup (197 ‚Üí 35 warnings, 82% reduction)
- ‚úÖ **ELIMINATED:** All jest/no-conditional-expect, no-unnecessary-act, no-container, no-wait-for-multiple-assertions, prefer-screen-queries violations
- ‚úÖ **OPTIMIZED:** Git workflow (pre-commit allows warnings, pre-push enforces zero tolerance)
- ‚úÖ **VALIDATED:** Mixed AST/manual approach with documented patterns
- ‚úÖ **DEMONSTRATED:** Option 2 high-ROI strategy (82% improvement with minimal effort)
  - Rewrite test patterns to use proper Testing Library queries
  - Eliminate container.querySelector usage patterns
  - Fix conditional expect patterns in test files
- Split config.js (1,576 lines) into domain modules:
  - `config/climate.js` - Climate and weather constants
  - `config/portfolio.js` - Investment and portfolio logic  
  - `config/formatting.js` - Display formatting utilities
  - `config/microclimate.js` - Microclimate calculations
- Split simulationEngine.js (1,001 lines) into focused modules

**Phase 1C: Test Coverage Critical Path** (~$1-2)
- Add unit tests for high-risk, zero-coverage services:
  - `enhancedWeatherIntegration.js` (0% ‚Üí 60%)
  - `forecastingEngine.js` (0% ‚Üí 60%)
  - `simulationEngine.js` (7.76% ‚Üí 60%)

### **Phase 2: Architectural Cleanup** (~$3-4 total)

**Phase 2A: Service Decoupling** (~$2-3)
- Implement dependency injection for databaseService
- Extract responsibilities from databaseService.js god object
- Define clear service boundaries and interfaces

**Phase 2B: Configuration Consolidation** (~$1-2)
- Centralize 6 scattered config files into coherent system
- Create configuration validation and type checking
- Document configuration architecture

### **Success Metrics**
- **File sizes**: Average <400 lines (currently many >800)
- **Test coverage**: >50% overall (currently 32.73%)
- **Linting errors**: 0 ‚úÖ (was 197 problems) - **ACHIEVED**
- **Linting warnings**: Target <20 (currently 163 - systematic refactoring needed)
- **Maintainability score**: >80 (currently 68)

### **Previous Priorities** (Deferred until maintainability improved)
- User Experience Polish - Deferred to Phase 3
- Performance Optimization - Deferred to Phase 3  
- Mobile Responsiveness - Deferred to Phase 3
- Advanced Features - Blocked until technical debt reduced

## üõ°Ô∏è QUALITY DRIFT PREVENTION PLAN

### **Prevention Systems Implementation** (~$1-2)
**Goal:** Prevent future accumulation of 197+ warnings through systematic prevention

**Prevention Systems - IMPLEMENTED:**
- ‚úÖ **PROJECT_QUALITY.md**: Quality standards and prevention checklist documented
- ‚úÖ **Quality metrics tracking**: `/quality-check` command for monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Team guidelines**: AST vs manual framework documented
- ‚úÖ **CI quality gates**: GitHub Actions workflow with warning thresholds
- ‚úÖ **Daily maintenance principle**: Automated in quality standards
- ‚úÖ **Tool synchronization**: Guidelines established in PROJECT_QUALITY.md
- ‚úÖ **Prevention-first architecture**: Quality gates integrated into workflow

**Remaining Active Tasks:**
- [ ] **Automate remaining patterns**: Create AST codemod for no-render-in-setup violations

### **Remaining Technical Debt Management**
**Current State:** 35 warnings remaining (acceptable technical debt)
- 30 `testing-library/no-node-access` violations (diminishing returns - manual effort)
- 4 `testing-library/no-render-in-setup` violations (good AST codemod candidate) 
- 1 `testing-library/prefer-screen-queries` violation (manual fix)

**Strategic Approach:** Monitor drift, address systematically when count exceeds thresholds
- **Green:** <10 warnings (excellent)
- **Yellow:** 10-25 warnings (acceptable, schedule cleanup)  
- **Red:** 25+ warnings (immediate systematic cleanup required)

## üí° FUTURE ENHANCEMENT IDEAS

### **Feature Expansions**
- **Pest & Disease Alerts** - Regional pest pressure and disease timing alerts
- **Water Management** - Location-specific irrigation planning based on climate data
- **Microclimate Adjustments** - Factor in user's specific site conditions (slope, exposure, soil type)

### **User Experience**
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - Optimize the location selection and garden planning for mobile gardeners
- **Garden Photo Integration** - Upload and track garden progress with photos

### **Advanced Features**
- **Multi-Location Support** - Compare recommendations across different properties/zones
- **Historical Weather Analysis** - Use past weather data to refine growing season predictions
- **Crop Rotation Planning** - Multi-year planning with location-specific rotation schedules
- **Yield Tracking** - Track actual harvest yields vs. predictions to improve recommendations
- **Community Features** - Share gardens and learn from other gardeners in similar zones
