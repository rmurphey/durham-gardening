# Active Work - Current Session Focus

*Updated: 2025-06-27*

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### **Learning Experiment Status** 
**Current Phase**: Code quality and infrastructure maturity âœ…
**Budget Used**: ~$25-30 of $400-600 (excellent efficiency)
**Key Gap Identified**: AI development workflow supervision requirements

### **Recommended Next Areas**
1. **User Experience Polish** (~$2-3) - Address any remaining UI/UX issues
2. **Performance Optimization** (~$2-3) - Bundle size, load times, rendering efficiency  
3. **Error Handling Refinement** (~$2-3) - Improve graceful degradation and user feedback
4. **Mobile Responsiveness** (~$3-4) - Ensure garden planning works well on mobile devices

### **Quick Wins** (~$1-2 each)
- Eliminate unused code cleanup
- CSS refactoring into modules  
- Design system updates review
- Mobile responsiveness improvements

### **Advanced Features** (~$5-8 each)
- Season Extension Planning - Cold frames, row covers by zone
- Companion Planting Integration - Zone-aware suggestions from database
- Onboarding Flow - Guided setup for new users

## âœ… Recent Completions

**Session Recap: Test Coverage & Code Quality** - COMPLETED (~$4-5 total)
- Comprehensive test coverage for variety recommendation services (555+ lines of tests)
- Removed 5 unused files (779 lines of dead code eliminated)  
- Location-agnostic refactoring (eliminated Durham-specific references)
- File organization improvements (renamed configs to generic patterns)
- All functionality preserved, codebase much cleaner and more maintainable

**Regional Plant Varieties** - COMPLETED (~$3-4 actual)
- Created `regionalVarietyRecommendations.js` service for zone-specific cultivar recommendations
- Added `getPlantVarieties()` method to database service to query plant varieties and seed products
- Built zone compatibility scoring algorithm considering zone range, climate factors, and tolerances
- Enhanced plant recommendations with best variety suggestions and zone suitability ratings
- Updated `EnhancedPlantRecommendations` component to display variety recommendations with pricing/vendor info
- Added `varietyRecommendationService.js` for simplified variety access throughout the app
- Location recommendations now include variety-specific guidance (e.g., "Plant Cherokee Purple tomatoes for Zone 7b")

**Database Integration** - COMPLETED (~$3-4 actual)
- Connected comprehensive plant database (79 growing tips, 56 companion relationships) to location-aware recommendations
- Created `databaseLocationRecommendations.js` service to bridge database and static data
- Enhanced `enhancedLocationRecommendations.js` to use database-integrated data
- Updated location recommendations system to fall back gracefully when database unavailable
- Growing tips and companion planting now integrated into main recommendation flow
- All plant recommendations now enhanced with database depth when available

**Monte Carlo Calendar Generation - Phase 1** - COMPLETED (~$2-3 actual)
- Transformed simulation from abstract yield histograms to date-specific garden events
- Created `generateCalendarFromScenario()` - converts weather scenarios to planting/harvest windows
- Modified `runMonteCarloSimulation()` to output probabilistic calendar data for each iteration
- Built consensus algorithm `generateProbabilisticCalendar()` aggregating 5,000 scenario calendars
- Now generates actionable recommendations: "Plant tomatoes April 15-25 (70% confidence)"

**Weather Data Integration** - COMPLETED (~$3-4 actual)
- Real forecast data now drives Monte Carlo simulation
- Hook composition pattern: useWeatherData â†’ useSimulation â†’ enhanced predictions
- Graceful degradation when weather APIs unavailable

**Species Coverage Expansion** - COMPLETED (~$3 actual)
- Expanded database from 22 â†’ 41 varieties (+86%)

**Documentation Restructure** - COMPLETED
- Automated workflow with learning triggers built into CLAUDE.md
- Cost reality check: estimates were 3-4x higher than actual usage
