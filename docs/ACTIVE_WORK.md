- Address unused variables and imports
- Clean up code style inconsistencies

**Week 2: Monolithic File Breakdown** (~$2-3)
- Split config.js (1,576 lines) into domain modules:
  - `config/climate.js` - Climate and weather constants
  - `config/portfolio.js` - Investment and portfolio logic  
  - `config/formatting.js` - Display formatting utilities
  - `config/microclimate.js` - Microclimate calculations
- Split simulationEngine.js (1,001 lines) into focused modules

**Week 3: Test Coverage Critical Path** (~$1-2)
- Add unit tests for high-risk, zero-coverage services:
  - `enhancedWeatherIntegration.js` (0% → 60%)
  - `forecastingEngine.js` (0% → 60%)
  - `simulationEngine.js` (7.76% → 60%)

### **Phase 2: Architectural Cleanup** (~$3-4 total)

**Week 4: Service Decoupling** (~$2-3)
- Implement dependency injection for databaseService
- Extract responsibilities from databaseService.js god object
- Define clear service boundaries and interfaces

**Week 5: Configuration Consolidation** (~$1-2)
- Centralize 6 scattered config files into coherent system
- Create configuration validation and type checking
- Document configuration architecture

### **Success Metrics**
- **File sizes**: Average <400 lines (currently many >800)
- **Test coverage**: >50% overall (currently 32.73%)
- **Linting warnings**: <20 (currently 197)
- **Maintainability score**: >80 (currently 68)

### **Previous Priorities** (Deferred until maintainability improved)
- User Experience Polish - Deferred to Phase 3
- Performance Optimization - Deferred to Phase 3  
- Mobile Responsiveness - Deferred to Phase 3
- Advanced Features - Blocked until technical debt reduced

## 💡 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT IDEAS

### **Feature Expansions**
- **Pest & Disease Alerts** - Regional pest pressure and disease timing alerts
- **Water Management** - Location-specific irrigation planning based on climate data
- **Microclimate Adjustments** - Factor in user's specific site conditions (slope, exposure, soil type)

### **User Experience**
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - Optimize the location selection and garden planning for mobile gardeners
- **Garden Photo Integration** - Upload and track garden progress with photos

### **Advanced Features**
- **Multi-Location Support** - Compare recommendations across different properties/zones
- **Historical Weather Analysis** - Use past weather data to refine growing season predictions
- **Crop Rotation Planning** - Multi-year planning with location-specific rotation schedules
- **Yield Tracking** - Track actual harvest yields vs. predictions to improve recommendations
- **Community Features** - Share gardens and learn from other gardeners in similar zones

## ✅ Recent Completions

**Repository Maintainability Assessment & Planning** - COMPLETED (~$1-2 actual)
- Comprehensive maintainability analysis across 5 dimensions (code, architecture, docs, workflow, dependencies)
- Overall score: 68/100 (Fair) - maintainable but requires effort
- Identified critical issues: 197 ESLint warnings, 5 files >800 lines, 32.73% test coverage
- Created /maintainability command for ongoing health monitoring
- Developed 5-week technical debt reduction plan targeting 80+ maintainability score
- Prioritized maintainability over new features to prevent complexity accumulation

**AST-Based Architectural Refactoring** - COMPLETED (~$2-3 actual)
- Eliminated static GLOBAL_CROP_DATABASE entirely using jscodeshift AST transformations
- Forced all services to use SQLite database instead of mixed data sources
- Created custom codemods for systematic removal of static fallback methods
- Fixed architectural debt: no more redundant static/database dual systems
- All plant data now sources exclusively from database with proper error handling
- Learned AST tooling limitations: generated invalid throw expressions requiring manual fix

**Session Recap: Test Coverage & Code Quality** - COMPLETED (~$4-5 total)
- Comprehensive test coverage for variety recommendation services (555+ lines of tests)
- Removed 5 unused files (779 lines of dead code eliminated)  
- Location-agnostic refactoring (eliminated Durham-specific references)
- File organization improvements (renamed configs to generic patterns)
- All functionality preserved, codebase much cleaner and more maintainable

**Regional Plant Varieties** - COMPLETED (~$3-4 actual)
- Created `regionalVarietyRecommendations.js` service for zone-specific cultivar recommendations
- Added `getPlantVarieties()` method to database service to query plant varieties and seed products
