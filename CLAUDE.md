# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal garden management system for a Durham, NC garden (Zone 7) containing detailed documentation for:
- Monthly garden calendar with planting and care schedules
- Individual plant care guides for specific varieties
- Detailed planting schedule organized by bed location and timing
- Space management for succession planting and seasonal transitions

## Content Structure

- **garden_calendar.md**: Monthly overview of all planting, care, and harvest tasks
- **planting_schedule.md**: Detailed table showing what to plant when and where
- **plant_care_guides/**: Individual care guides for each crop variety
- **Legacy files**: Original seed ordering documentation (for reference)

## Working with This Repository

When editing or adding content:
- Maintain consistent markdown formatting across all files
- Keep seasonal timing information relevant to Zone 7 growing conditions
- Use clear, actionable tables and checklists for garden tasks
- Update space calculations when changing plant spacing or bed assignments
- Focus on practical garden management over theoretical information

## Garden Management Focus

- **Monthly planning**: What to plant, when, and where in specific beds
- **Space optimization**: Succession planting and intercropping in limited space
- **Fresh eating priority**: Varieties and harvest timing for immediate consumption
- **Seasonal transitions**: Moving from summer to winter crops efficiently
- **Container mobility**: Using moveable containers to optimize growing conditions

This repository serves as a complete garden management system for year-round growing in Durham, NC.

## Project overview

This project is for a garden in Durham, North Carolina. In addition to a variety of shaded and unshaded areas in the yard, the garden includes:

- **3×15 Bed**: Long bed (45 sq ft)
- **4×8 Bed**: Medium bed (32 sq ft)
- **4×5 Bed**: Small bed (20 sq ft)
- **Containers**: Individual pots (15-20 sq ft total)

## Gardening Preferences & Constraints

- **Budget**: No significant constraints on seed purchases
- **Storage**: Limited cold/dark storage space - prioritize varieties for fresh eating and short-term storage
- **Seed suppliers**: Primary preference for True Leaf Market (proven success), open to other suppliers when needed
- **Time availability**: Daily maintenance possible, larger projects scheduled for weekends
- **Focus**: Emphasize fresh harvest varieties over long-storage crops due to storage limitations
- **Irrigation**: Backyard sprinkler system with basic automation covers all garden beds and containers

## Sun Exposure

- **Main garden beds**: All three beds (3×15, 4×8, 4×5) receive ~6 hours of good sun daily - suitable for most vegetables
- **Front yard**: Significantly shaded by trees with some morning sun areas - contains existing plantings (ferns, hydrangea, jacob's ladder, other ornamentals) with limited space for edibles
- **Container placement**: Can be moved to optimize sun exposure as needed
