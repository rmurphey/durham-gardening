# Efficient Species Expansion Plan

Cost-optimized approach to expand from 22 to 50+ varieties within $20 budget.

## Current Gap Analysis
**Missing Critical Crops:** Tomatoes, beans, squash, corn, onions, garlic, potatoes
**Impact:** These 7 crop families represent 80% of US home gardens

## Phase 1: High-Impact Additions (15 varieties)
**Budget Target:** $15-20 total

### Tomatoes (4 varieties)
- Roma (determinate, paste)
- Cherokee Purple (indeterminate, heirloom) 
- Sun Gold (cherry, early)
- Stupice (cold-hardy, early)

### Beans (3 varieties)
- Provider (bush bean, reliable)
- Kentucky Wonder (pole bean, heirloom)
- Henderson Bush Lima (lima bean)

### Squash (3 varieties)
- Black Beauty Zucchini (summer)
- Butternut (winter storage)
- Acorn (winter, compact)

### Alliums (2 varieties)
- Yellow Sweet Spanish (onion)
- Music (hardneck garlic)

### Staples (3 varieties)
- Golden Bantam (sweet corn)
- Yukon Gold (potato)
- Detroit Dark Red (beet)

## Research Strategy
1. **Use extension service variety recommendations** (1-2 sources per crop)
2. **Leverage seed company data** for zones/characteristics
3. **Template approach:** 5 data points per variety maximum
4. **Batch by crop family** to minimize context switching

## Data Template (Minimal Viable)
- Zones: min/max hardiness
- Temperature: tolerance ratings
- Timing: days to maturity, planting months
- Spacing: basic requirements
- Notes: 1-2 key growing tips

**Target: 3-4 minutes research + data entry per variety**

## Success Metrics
- Cover vegetables grown by 85% of US gardeners
- Double useful variety count (22 â†’ 37)
- Maintain database quality standards
- Stay within $20 budget
