## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with hooks-based state management
- **Statistics**: jStat library for Monte Carlo simulation
- **Charting**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Styling**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
- **Storage**: localStorage for configuration persistence
- **Build & Development**: Craco + Vercel (see Architecture Notes below)

### Build & Deployment Architecture

**Craco (Frontend Build Tool)**
- Webpack configuration override for Create React App
- **Purpose**: Database/WASM browser support - enables SQLite (sql.js) to work in browser
- **Key features**: Node.js polyfills (crypto, stream, path), WASM file handling, database asset copying
- **When**: Development server (`npm start`) and production builds (`npm run build`)

**Vercel (Full-Stack Platform)**  
- Hosting platform with serverless API functions
- **Purpose**: Weather API endpoints and cloud deployment
- **Key features**: API routes (`/api/weather`, `/api/garden`), cron jobs, CDN, edge functions
- **When**: Production hosting and API runtime (`npm run dev:vercel` for local API testing)

**Why Both Are Needed**:
- **Craco**: Required for complex SQLite database integration in browser
- **Vercel**: Required for weather API and cloud storage functionality  
- **Complementary**: Craco handles frontend complexity, Vercel handles backend/hosting

### Recent Development Notes

**Data Architecture Discovery (2025-06-23)**:
- The application currently uses static crop data from `src/config.js` rather than the SQLite database
- Database stores planting months as JSON strings (`"[4, 5, 6]"`) while the app expects JavaScript arrays (`[4, 5, 6]`)
- Fixed `isPlantingSeasonValid` function to handle both static array data and JSON string data with proper error handling
- Development server stability improved using `nodemon` instead of custom solutions

**Server Stability**:
- Replaced custom development server with industry-standard `nodemon` for auto-restart functionality
- Use `npm run dev` for best development experience with automatic file watching and server restart

**Database vs Static Data**:
- SQLite database in `/database/plant_varieties.db` contains comprehensive crop data with regional planting schedules
- React app uses hardcoded `GLOBAL_CROP_DATABASE` for performance and simplicity
- Future integration would require JSON parsing of database strings and client-side database querying

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with weather APIs for live data
- Database-driven crop data instead of static configuration
- Additional crop varieties and regional adaptations
- Export functionality for garden calendars
- Social sharing of simulation results
- Advanced risk modeling for climate change scenarios
