## Climate Betting Framework

### **Heat Wave Scenarios**
**Bet on intensity and duration of summer heat:**

| Scenario | Temperature Range | Duration | Probability | Garden Impact |
|----------|------------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Mild Summer** | 85-95°F peaks | June-August | 20% | Traditional crops might survive |
| **Normal Heat** | 95-100°F peaks | June-September | 30% | Current heat-adapted strategy works |
| **Extreme Heat** | 100-107°F peaks | May-September | 40% | Your current planning scenario |
| **Catastrophic** | 107°F+ sustained | April-October | 10% | Only extreme heat specialists survive |

### **Winter Scenarios**
**Bet on how warm winters actually get:**

| Scenario | Winter Lows | Duration | Probability | Garden Impact |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Traditional Winter** | 20-30°F lows | Dec-Feb | 15% | Need cold protection |
| **Mild Winter** | 30-40°F lows | Dec-Jan | 35% | Extended cool season |
| **Warm Winter** | 40-50°F lows | Dec-Jan | 40% | Your current planning |
| **No Winter** | 50°F+ minimum | Year-round | 10% | Continuous growing season |

## Crop Hedging Strategies

### **Portfolio Allocation Model**

#### **Conservative Portfolio (60% success rate)**
- **40%** - Heat specialists (okra, peppers, eggplant)
- **35%** - Cool-season sure bets (lettuce, carrots, radishes)
- **15%** - Perennial insurance (herbs, nasturtiums)
- **10%** - Experimental/hedge crops

#### **Aggressive Portfolio (80% upside, 40% downside)**
- **25%** - Heat specialists
- **50%** - Cool-season expansion
- **15%** - High-value experiments (microgreens, specialty herbs)
- **10%** - Climate adaptation bets

#### **Hedge Portfolio (70% success rate)**
- **30%** - Heat specialists
- **40%** - Cool-season proven performers
- **20%** - Perennial insurance
- **10%** - Season extenders (row covers, shade systems)

## Simulation Mechanics

### **Monthly Climate Rolls**
**Each month, roll for weather reality:**

- **Temperature deviation**: ±10°F from scenario prediction
- **Precipitation**: 50-150% of normal
- **Heat wave events**: 0-3 extreme heat periods per summer month
- **Surprise weather**: 10% chance of completely unexpected conditions

### **Crop Performance Multipliers**

#### **Heat Specialists (Okra, Peppers, Eggplant)**
- **Mild/Normal summer**: 0.8x yield (not hot enough)
- **Extreme summer**: 1.2x yield (optimal conditions)
- **Catastrophic summer**: 1.0x yield (only survivors)

#### **Cool Season Crops (Lettuce, Carrots, Beans)**
- **Mild summer**: 1.3x yield (can grow year-round)
- **Normal summer**: 1.0x yield (cool season only)
- **Extreme summer**: 0.7x yield (shortened season)
- **Catastrophic summer**: 0.5x yield (survival mode)

#### **Perennial Insurance (Herbs, Nasturtiums)**
- **Any scenario**: 0.9-1.1x yield (stable performers)
- **Bonus**: Provide continuous harvest regardless of annual crop failures

## Economic Simulation

### **Investment Tracking**
- **Seed costs**: $75-105 per season order
- **Infrastructure**: $80-140 drip irrigation (one-time)
- **Inputs**: $10/month compost, minimal other costs
- **Labor**: Free (within full-time work constraints)

### **Return Calculations**
- **Heat specialists**: $4-6/lb market value vs. $3-4/packet investment
- **Cool season**: $2-4/lb market value vs. $3-4/packet investment
- **Herbs**: $15+/oz market value vs. $3-4/packet investment
- **Perennials**: Multi-year returns on single investment

### **Hedge Strategies**
1. **Season Insurance**: Plant both heat and cool specialists
2. **Timing Hedges**: Early/late plantings to avoid weather extremes
3. **Location Hedges**: Containers + beds for mobility
4. **Infrastructure Hedges**: Shade + protection systems

## Sample Simulation Run

### **Year 1 Scenario: "Extreme Heat" + "Warm Winter"**

**Climate Reality**:
- Summer: 102°F peaks from June-September
- Winter: 45°F minimum, no freezes

**Portfolio Performance**:
- **Heat specialists**: 120% yield (okra thriving)
- **Cool season**: 70% yield (shortened season)
- **Herbs**: 110% yield (year-round growth)

**Economic Result**:
- **Investment**: $165 (seeds + infrastructure)
- **Harvest value**: $320 (heavy on high-value heat crops)
- **Net return**: $155 (94% ROI)

### **Year 2 Scenario: "Mild Summer" + "Traditional Winter"**

**Climate Reality**:
- Summer: 88°F peaks, manageable heat
- Winter: 25°F lows, need protection

**Portfolio Performance**:
- **Heat specialists**: 80% yield (not hot enough for peak performance)
- **Cool season**: 130% yield (can grow through mild summer)
- **Herbs**: 90% yield (winter protection needed)

**Economic Result**:
- **Investment**: $85 (seeds only, infrastructure already installed)
- **Harvest value**: $285 (heavy on cool-season volume)
- **Net return**: $200 (235% ROI)

## Hedging Recommendations

### **Climate Hedge Bets**
1. **Infrastructure first**: Drip irrigation + shade pay off in any scenario
2. **Diversify timing**: Don't put all plantings in one season
3. **Container mobility**: Move high-value crops to optimal microclimates
4. **Succession insurance**: Multiple small plantings vs. large single bets

### **Economic Hedges**
1. **High-value focus**: Herbs and specialty crops have best risk/reward
2. **Perennial bias**: Multi-year returns reduce annual risk
3. **Proven performers**: Weight portfolio toward known successes
4. **Avoid heroics**: Don't chase marginal crops in extreme conditions

### **Practical Implementation**
- **Track real outcomes** vs. predicted scenarios
- **Adjust portfolio** based on actual climate patterns
- **Document what works** for future planning
- **Calculate actual ROI** to validate strategy

This simulation helps you make informed bets on climate patterns while hedging your crop portfolio for multiple weather scenarios.
