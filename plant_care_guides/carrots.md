## Growing Tips
- **Soil prep:** Work soil deeply, add compost for drainage
- **Seed starting:** Pre-soak seeds 2-4 hours for better germination
- **Row covers:** Use in extreme heat to prevent bolting

## Common Issues
- **Poor germination:** Keep soil moist, don't plant too deep
- **Forked roots:** Remove rocks, don't over-fertilize with nitrogen
- **Pests:** Carrot rust fly (row covers help)

## Space Planning
- **Bed allocation:** 8-12 linear feet per succession planting
- **Companion plants:** Excellent with beans, nasturtiums, pak choi
- **Between-row planting:** Perfect for filling spaces between larger crops
