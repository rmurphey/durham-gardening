# Parsnips - Hollow Crown & Harris Model

## Variety Details
- **Hollow Crown:** Classic heirloom variety (1 oz packet)
- **Harris Model:** Improved variety, more uniform (3g packet)
- **Days to maturity:** 100-120 days (long-season crop)
- **Size:** 8-12 inches long, 2-3 inches wide at top

## Planting
- **When:** July for winter harvest (plant for 100+ day growing period)
- **Where:** Deep, loose soil in main beds
- **Spacing:** 4-6 inches apart in rows
- **Depth:** Â½ inch deep
- **Soil:** Deep, loose, rock-free soil essential for straight roots

## Care
- **Germination:** Slow and irregular (14-21 days), keep soil moist
- **Thinning:** Thin to proper spacing when 2-3 inches tall
- **Water:** Consistent moisture throughout long growing season
- **Fertilizer:** Light feeding, avoid fresh manure (causes forked roots)
- **Patience:** Very slow initial growth, picks up pace in fall

## Long-Season Management
- **Summer care:** Weed regularly, maintain consistent moisture
- **Fall development:** Most growth happens in cool fall weather
- **Winter harvest:** Sweetest after exposure to frost
- **Storage:** Can remain in ground through winter with mulch

## Harvest
- **When:** After first frost for best sweetness (October-December)
- **Method:** Dig carefully with spade, avoid breaking roots
- **Storage:** Limited cold storage space - harvest as needed
- **Fresh eating:** Sweetest when freshly dug in cold weather

## Soil Preparation
- **Deep cultivation:** Work soil 12-15 inches deep
- **Remove obstacles:** Clear all rocks, debris that could cause forking
- **Organic matter:** Add compost, but avoid fresh manure
- **Drainage:** Ensure good drainage to prevent rot

## Common Issues
- **Poor germination:** Keep soil consistently moist, be patient
- **Forked roots:** Caused by rocks, fresh manure, or compacted soil
- **Slow growth:** Normal - most growth happens in fall
- **Pests:** Generally pest-free, occasional carrot rust fly

## Space Planning
- **Bed allocation:** 15-20 sq ft total for both varieties
- **Long-term commitment:** Occupies space for 4-5 months
- **Succession planting:** Not recommended due to long season
- **Companion plants:** Plant quick crops nearby early in season

## Special Considerations
- **Two varieties:** Provides backup in case one variety fails
- **Winter harvest:** Plan for cold-weather harvesting tools and storage
- **Fresh eating focus:** Harvest throughout winter rather than bulk storage
- **Cold hardiness:** Improves in flavor with cold exposure

## Timing Critical
- **July planting:** Essential for winter harvest timing
- **Don't delay:** Late planting won't develop properly before winter
- **Plan ahead:** Prepare soil area in June for July planting
