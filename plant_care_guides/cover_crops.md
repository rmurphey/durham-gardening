## Management Through Seasons

### Fall (September-November)
- Plant cover crops in cleared areas
- Water if establishment period is dry
- Monitor germination and growth

### Winter (December-February)
- Cover crops go dormant but roots remain active
- Minimal maintenance required
- Plan spring termination timing

### Spring (March-April)
- **Termination timing**: 2-3 weeks before vegetable planting
- **Method**: Mow close to ground, let residue dry
- **Incorporation**: Light tilling to mix residue into soil
- **Wait period**: Allow 2-3 weeks for decomposition before planting

## Integration with Vegetable Schedule

### September Planting Strategy
1. Harvest finished summer crops (beans, early tomatoes)
2. Clear and prepare empty bed sections
3. Plant cover crops in areas not needed for fall vegetables
4. Continue fall vegetable plantings in designated areas

### Spring Transition Strategy
1. **Early March**: Mow cover crops before they get too tall
2. **Mid-March**: Light till to incorporate residue
3. **Early April**: Begin spring vegetable plantings
4. **Soil benefit**: Improved soil structure and fertility for vegetables

This approach maximizes soil health while maintaining productive vegetable growing space throughout the year.
