# Pak Choi - White Stem & Shanghai  
*Cool Season Priority Crop*

## Variety Details
- **White Stem Pak Choi:** Classic variety with thick white stems (4g packet)
- **Shanghai Pak Choi:** All-green variety, versatile for microgreens too (3g packet)
- **Days to maturity:** 45-50 days full size, 25-35 days baby greens
- **Climate reality:** Heat-sensitive crop, not suitable for summer heat survival strategy

## Heat-Adapted Growing Strategy
- **PRIMARY SEASONS:** October-March (peak productivity)
- **Secondary:** April & September (transition periods only)
- **Summer:** NOT RECOMMENDED - bolts immediately in heat, poor water efficiency
- **Where:** Any main bed during cool seasons, morning sun preferred
- **Spacing:** 6-8 inches apart for full heads, 4 inches for baby greens/microgreens
- **Depth:** ¼ inch deep
- **Soil:** Rich, well-draining soil enhanced with cheap compost ($10/40lb)

## Seasonal Care Focus
### **Cool Season Production (Oct-Mar)**
- **Water:** Drip irrigation preferred, consistent moisture critical
- **Temperature:** Thrives in 50-70°F range (common during peak season)  
- **Fertilizer:** Monthly compost application, responds well to consistent feeding
- **Success rate:** High yields, excellent quality, multiple successions possible

### **Summer Reality Check**
- **Heat sensitivity:** Bolts to seed within days above 80°F
- **Water inefficiency:** Requires constant moisture when heat-stressed
- **Economic reality:** Poor return on water/space investment vs. cool season crops
- **Recommendation:** Skip summer entirely, focus effort on heat-adapted crops

## Growing Options
- **Full size heads:** Space 6-8 inches apart, harvest whole plant
- **Baby greens:** Space 2-3 inches apart, harvest young leaves
- **Cut-and-come-again:** Harvest outer leaves, let center continue growing

## Harvest
- **Baby greens:** 25-35 days, cut outer leaves
- **Full heads:** 45-50 days, harvest entire plant
- **Storage:** Use within a few days; excellent fresh eating
- **Cooking:** Stir-fry stems and leaves separately (stems take longer)

## Succession Planting
- **Summer planting:** June, small succession due to heat sensitivity
- **Fall planting:** August through September for best results
- **Cool weather:** Sweetest flavor in fall/winter growing

## Common Issues
- **Bolting:** Plant too late in spring or too early in summer heat
- **Pests:** Flea beetles, cabbage worms (row covers help)
- **Disease:** Club root in overly wet soils

## Space Planning
- **Bed allocation:** 6-8 sq ft per planting for full heads
- **Companion plants:** Works well with carrots, beans, nasturtiums
- **Quick turnover:** Good for succession planting in same space

## Special Uses
- **Shanghai variety:** Can be grown as microgreens in containers
- **Continuous harvest:** Both varieties excellent for cut-and-come-again method
- **Container growing:** Works well in larger containers (12+ inches deep)
