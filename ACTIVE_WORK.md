# Active Work - Current Session Focus

*Updated: 2025-06-27*

## Current Priority  
âœ… **Documentation Restructure** - COMPLETED
- Automated workflow with learning triggers built into CLAUDE.md
- Separated active work, technical learnings, and process insights
- Reduced AI context overhead while improving human scanning

## Recent Completions
âœ… **Species Coverage Expansion** - Expanded database from 22 â†’ 41 varieties (+86%), cost ~$23

## Next Up
ðŸŽ¯ **Weather Data Integration** - the simulation should incorporate updated weather data
- Current: Simulation uses static climate scenarios
- Goal: Integrate real forecast data into Monte Carlo simulation
- Estimated effort: ~$15-25 based on existing weather integration patterns

## Quick Wins Available  
- Eliminate unused code cleanup
- CSS refactoring into modules
- Design system updates review

## Blockers & Decisions Needed
*None currently*

## Quick Capture
*Use /todo or /idea commands to add items here*

## Next Session Prep
- Weather simulation integration ready to start
- Database expansion proved much cheaper than expected
- Good momentum on architectural improvements
