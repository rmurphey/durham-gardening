## âœ… Recent Completions

**Monte Carlo Calendar Generation - Phase 1** - COMPLETED (~$2-3 actual)
- Transformed simulation from abstract yield histograms to date-specific garden events
- Created `generateCalendarFromScenario()` - converts weather scenarios to planting/harvest windows
- Modified `runMonteCarloSimulation()` to output probabilistic calendar data for each iteration
- Built consensus algorithm `generateProbabilisticCalendar()` aggregating 5,000 scenario calendars
- Now generates actionable recommendations: "Plant tomatoes April 15-25 (70% confidence)"

**Weather Data Integration** - COMPLETED (~$3-4 actual)
- Real forecast data now drives Monte Carlo simulation
- Hook composition pattern: useWeatherData â†’ useSimulation â†’ enhanced predictions
- Graceful degradation when weather APIs unavailable

**Species Coverage Expansion** - COMPLETED (~$3 actual)
- Expanded database from 22 â†’ 41 varieties (+86%)

**Documentation Restructure** - COMPLETED
- Automated workflow with learning triggers built into CLAUDE.md
- Cost reality check: estimates were 3-4x higher than actual usage
