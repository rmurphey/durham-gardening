# Durham, NC Garden Calendar - Zone 7
*Heat-Adapted Garden System*

## New Climate Reality - Extended Heat + Warmer Winters
**Current Status (June 2025)**: Record heat summers (100-107°F) + warmer winters becoming standard  
**New Growing Strategy**: **Year-round production with seasonal intensity shifts**  
**Peak Season**: **October through April** (mild winter = extended harvest)  
**Summer Strategy**: **Heat-specialized crops + infrastructure focus**  
**Winter Strategy**: **Extended cool-season production without traditional dormancy**

## Strategic Infrastructure Investment Plan (Multi-Year Value)
**Year 1 High-Value**: Shade cloth ($20), Drip irrigation starter ($40-60), Quality mulch ($20) - **Total: ~$80-100**  
**Year 2 Expansion**: Complete drip system coverage ($40-80), Permanent mulch pathways ($30-50)  
**Ongoing Low-Cost**: Compost ($10/month), seeds for proven varieties, system maintenance  
**Avoid**: Expensive structures, annual costly inputs, short-term plant救 rescue attempts

## Monthly Garden Schedule

| Month | Existing Plant Care | Heat Management | Available Space Additions | New Systematic Areas | Irrigation & Feeding | Key Tasks |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **June** | 🥄 Side-dress heat-tolerant crops only. Support cucumber. Deadhead marigolds | **Invest in shade cloth ($20)** - reusable every summer. **Let struggling squash die** - don't waste money saving them | **NO new plantings** - focus on survival | **Plan drip irrigation** for fall installation | Morning watering only (5:30-6:30 AM), 25-30 min. 🥄 Cheap compost only ($10) | **Survival + smart infrastructure planning** |
| **July** | 🥬 Harvest early morning only. Deep mulch everything. **Clear dead/dying plants** | **Expect hottest month**. Shade cloth for containers. Morning-only garden work | **NO plantings** - anything planted will likely die | **Plan for September restart** | **Increase watering** - may need twice daily for containers. No feeding | **Survival only** - expect losses |
| **August** | Continue minimal care. **Accept plant losses**. Maintain only thriving plants | Late August *might* bring slight relief. Prep for fall recovery | **Still too hot** - wait for September. **Exception: Replant pumpkins early August** for Halloween harvest | **Prep beds for fall restart** in cooler areas | Maintain survival irrigation. Begin planning fall varieties | **Late summer prep** - still very hot |
| **September** | 🥬 Harvest survivors. **Assess damage**. Clear dead plants | **Finally cooler!** Remove failed summer crops | 🌱 **Fall restart**: Cool season crops in cleared spaces | 🌱 **Begin systematic beds**: First organized plantings | Reduce to 3x/week watering. 🥄 Resume feeding | **Garden recovery begins** |
| **October** | 🥬 Continue harvest from survivors. Plan winter protection | Normal fall temperatures | 🌱 **Peak fall planting** in all available spaces | 🌱 **Expand systematic areas** - cover crops + fall crops | **Install drip irrigation** - best time before winter. 🥄 Feed new plantings with cheap compost | **Major replanting + infrastructure month** |
| **November** | 🥬 **Continue active harvest** - no dormancy in warm winters | **Minimal winter protection needed** | 🌱 **Extended fall planting** - season runs longer | 🌱 **Expand systematic winter production** | Regular watering continues, 🥄 light feeding | **Extended growing season** |
| **December** | 🥬 **Active winter harvest** - lettuce, greens, herbs thrive | **Mild winter management** | 🌱 **Mid-winter succession plantings** possible | 🌱 **Year-round systematic production** | Moderate watering, 🥄 winter feeding for active growth | **Peak winter productivity** |
| **January** | 🥬 **Peak winter harvest** + 🌱 **major spring prep plantings** | **Design permanent shade for coming summer** | 🌱 **Heavy planting**: Cool crops that will mature before heat | 🛠️ **Expand year-round systematic beds** | Increase watering for active growth, heavy 🥄 compost | **Winter productivity + spring prep** |
| **February** | 🛠️ **Expand drip system** + 🌱 **spring succession** | **Complete heat infrastructure before March** | 🌱 **Final cool-season plantings** before heat buildup | 🌱 **Systematic spring beds** - maximize before summer | **Drip irrigation efficient watering**, 🥄 heavy compost feeding | **Complete infrastructure + final spring push** |
| **March** | 🌱 **Heat-tolerant spring varieties ONLY** | **Final heat prep before summer** | 🌱 **Last chance plantings** before heat season | 🌱 **Heat-specialized summer crops** (peppers, eggplant, okra) under shade | Transition to heat-season watering | **Transition to summer survival mode** |
| **April-May** | 🌱 **Summer survivors only**: established heat crops | **All shade/protection systems active** | 🥬 **Harvest spring crops before heat** | 🛠️ **Summer beds prepared for dormancy/minimal production** | **Full heat-season irrigation** - daily deep watering | **Pre-heat harvest, prepare for summer dormancy** |

- 🥬 Harvest
- 🛠️ Garden prep/planning work
- 🥄 Feeding/fertilizing

## Feeding Schedule Summary
- **Weekly**: Liquid fertilizer for okra only (June-September)
- **Monthly**: Compost for all other crops during growing season
- **At planting**: Bone meal for parsnips and transplants
- **Fall/Winter**: Minimal feeding, compost only for active growth

## Irrigation Programs
- **Summer (June-August)**: Every other day, 6 AM, 25 minutes
- **Spring/Fall (April-May, September-October)**: 3x/week, 6:30 AM, 20 minutes  
- **Winter (November-March)**: Manual operation, 1-2x/week as needed

## Year-Round Growing Strategy (Hot Summers + Warm Winters)

### **Peak Production Season (October-April)**
- **October-December**: Extended fall harvest + winter planting (no dormancy)
- **January-February**: Peak winter production + heavy spring prep
- **March-April**: Spring harvest race - beat the summer heat

### **Summer Management Season (May-September)**
- **May**: Final cool-season harvest + heat infrastructure activation
- **June-August**: Heat-specialized crops only + survival mode
- **September**: Recovery begins, fall restart

### **Year-Round Crop Selection**
- **Cool-season (Oct-Apr)**: All traditional cool crops + extended seasons
- **Heat-tolerant year-round**: Peppers, eggplant, okra, Mediterranean herbs, succulents
- **Warm-winter advantages**: Perennial herbs thrive, winter greens extended, no plant loss to cold

### **Long-term Infrastructure (Year-Round System)**
- **Summer shade**: Essential for 4-month extreme heat period
- **Winter productivity**: Extend growing areas (no cold protection needed)
- **Water efficiency**: Critical for year-round active growth
- **Soil management**: Constant production requires constant compost input

### **Daily Tasks - No True Dormant Season**
- **Peak season (Oct-Apr)**: Full garden activity, succession planting, heavy harvest
- **Summer transition (May-Sep)**: Morning-only care, infrastructure maintenance, heat-crop focus
- **Year-round**: Continuous watering, feeding, and harvest - no winter break
