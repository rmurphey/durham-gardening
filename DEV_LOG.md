# Development Log - Process & Workflow Insights

*Weekly observations about Claude Code development patterns and project evolution*

## Week of 2025-06-27

### Key Discoveries
- **Cost estimation dramatically wrong initially** - content work much cheaper than expected
- **Documentation structure evolution** - moved from exhaustive task lists to focused learning insights  
- **Database expansion workflow proven** - template approach scales efficiently

### Claude Code Workflow Patterns
- **Batch operations most efficient** - multiple database inserts in sequence vs. individual operations
- **Template-driven research** - structured data collection reduces context switching overhead
- **Automatic learning capture** - built documentation triggers into workflow for sustainability

### Project Direction Insights
- **Technical foundation solid** - architecture handles expansion well, content was the bottleneck
- **Learning-first approach working** - extracting development patterns more valuable than feature optimization
- **Cost control effective** - $23 for major database expansion vs. $400-600 budget shows good efficiency

### Tool Usage Observations
- SQLite database operations straightforward through CLI
- Git commit patterns with learning documentation working well
- File organization reducing cognitive load for both human and AI

### Budget & Efficiency Notes
- Database expansion: $23 actual vs. $300+ estimated (92% overestimate)
- Documentation restructure: ~$5-10 vs. ongoing session startup costs
- Total spend to date: ~$50-75 of $400-600 budget (good runway remaining)
