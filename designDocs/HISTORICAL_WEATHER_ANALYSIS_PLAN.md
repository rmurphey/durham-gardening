## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Configured location privacy**: Store only rounded coordinates (0.1Â° precision) for configured garden locations
- **Rate limiting**: Respect API quotas to prevent service disruption
- **Data validation**: Comprehensive validation of historical weather data inputs
- **Access controls**: Historical analysis tied to specific garden configurations, not user location

### API Security
- **Request validation**: Validate all location and date range parameters
- **Error handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose internal system details
- **Audit logging**: Track historical data requests for debugging and optimization

### Data Quality Controls
- **Source verification**: Track and validate data source reliability
