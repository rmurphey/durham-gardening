# Design Documents

This directory contains comprehensive design documents for major features and architectural decisions.

## Document Standards

All design documents follow a consistent structure:

### Required Sections
- **Overview & Goals**: Feature purpose and user value proposition
- **Technical Architecture**: Database schema, services, component structure
- **Security & Privacy**: Data protection, access controls, user safety
- **Content Moderation**: Validation, filtering, abuse prevention (for UGC features)
- **Implementation Phases**: Staged development with cost estimates
- **Integration Points**: Connections to existing systems
- **Risk Mitigation**: Performance, scalability, safety considerations
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes and KPIs

### Security Requirements
Every design must address:
- Input validation and sanitization
- User authentication and authorization
- Data encryption and privacy protection
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for security events
- Content filtering for user-generated content

### Content Safety (for UGC features)
Features accepting user content must include:
- File type and size restrictions
- Automated content screening
- User reporting mechanisms
- Clear usage guidelines
- Rapid violation response procedures

## Current Design Documents

### System Architecture
- `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` - SQLite database design and relationships
- `GARDEN_SCHEMA.md` - Vercel Blob storage structure for garden data

### Feature Designs
- `GARDEN_PHOTO_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Photo upload and tracking system

## Creating New Designs

Use the `/design` command to create new design documents:

```bash
/design feature-name "additional requirements"
```

This command automatically:
1. Analyzes current project state from `docs/ACTIVE_WORK.md`
2. Reviews existing architecture patterns
3. Creates comprehensive design document
4. Includes security and content safety requirements
5. Provides cost estimates and implementation phases

## Design Review Process

Before implementation, all designs should be:
1. **Technically reviewed** for architectural consistency
2. **Security assessed** for potential vulnerabilities
3. **Cost validated** against project budget constraints
4. **Integration verified** with existing systems
5. **User safety evaluated** for content moderation needs

This ensures high-quality, secure, and maintainable feature development.
