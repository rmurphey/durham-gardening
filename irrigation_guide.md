---

## Seasonal Watering Schedule

### June-August (Hot Season)
**Frequency**: Every other day (3-4 times per week)
**Duration**: 20-25 minutes per zone
**Best times**: 
- **Preferred**: 5:00-7:00 AM (reduces evaporation, allows leaves to dry)
- **Acceptable**: 6:00-8:00 PM (if morning not possible)

**Automation setting**: 
- Program for Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday
- 6:00 AM start time
- 25 minutes per zone

### September-October (Moderate Season)
**Frequency**: 2-3 times per week
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes per zone
**Best times**: 6:00-8:00 AM

**Automation setting**:
- Program for Monday, Thursday, Saturday
- 6:30 AM start time
- 20 minutes per zone

### November-March (Cool Season)
**Frequency**: 1-2 times per week (weather dependent)
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes per zone
**Best times**: Mid-morning (8:00-10:00 AM)

**Manual operation recommended**: Check soil moisture before watering

## Crop-Specific Considerations

### High Water Needs
- **Pak Choi**: Needs consistent moisture (90% water content)
- **Lettuce**: Requires steady moisture to prevent bolting
- **Containers**: Check daily, may need supplemental hand watering

### Moderate Water Needs
- **Beans**: Deep, less frequent watering preferred
- **Carrots**: Consistent moisture prevents splitting
- **Nasturtiums**: Moderate water, drought-tolerant once established

### Lower Water Needs (once established)
- **Okra**: Very drought tolerant, thrives in heat
- **Parsnips**: Deep taproot, less frequent watering

---

## Manual Override Situations

### Skip Automatic Watering When:
- **Rain forecast**: 0.5+ inches expected within 24 hours
- **Recent heavy rain**: Soil still moist from previous day's rain
- **Cool, cloudy weather**: Evaporation rates low
- **Fall/winter**: Soil stays moist longer

### Add Extra Watering When:
- **Heat wave**: Temperatures 90°F+ for multiple days
- **Windy conditions**: Increases evaporation
- **New plantings**: Seeds and transplants need extra moisture
- **Container plants**: Always check separately, dry out faster

---

## Soil Moisture Check

### Simple Test Methods:
1. **Finger test**: Stick finger 2-3 inches into soil
   - Moist = skip watering
   - Dry = water needed

2. **Visual cues**: 
   - Soil surface cracking = needs water
   - Plants wilting in morning = needs water
   - Mulch dry underneath = needs water

### Best Practice:
Check soil moisture every few days, even with automation running

---

## Container Considerations

### Containers Dry Faster:
- Check daily during hot weather
- May need hand watering between sprinkler cycles
- Morning check recommended

### Positioning for Sprinkler Coverage:
- Ensure containers are within sprinkler pattern
- Move containers if needed for better coverage
- Use drip trays to prevent water waste

---

## Water Conservation Tips

### Maximize Efficiency:
- **Mulch all beds**: Reduces evaporation by 50%+
- **Morning watering**: Less evaporation than midday
- **Deep, less frequent**: Encourages deep root growth
- **Skip when raining**: Don't waste water on wet soil

### Monitor and Adjust:
- Check system monthly for clogs or misaligned heads
- Adjust timing based on weather patterns
- Reduce frequency during cooler months

---

## Weather-Based Adjustments

### Hot & Dry Periods (90°F+):
- Increase frequency to daily if needed
- Extend duration by 5-10 minutes
- Check containers twice daily

### Rainy Periods:
- Turn off automation temporarily
- Resume 2-3 days after rain stops
- Check for overwatering signs (yellowing leaves)

### Seasonal Transitions:
- **Spring**: Gradually increase as temperatures rise
- **Fall**: Gradually decrease as temperatures drop
- **Winter**: Switch to manual, minimal watering

This system should provide excellent coverage for your Durham garden while conserving water and promoting healthy plant growth.
