## Heat-Adapted Seasonal Schedule

### **June-August (Extreme Heat Survival)**
**Reality**: 100-107°F with heat index up to 110°F
**Strategy**: Survival mode for existing plants only
**Frequency**: Daily watering may be needed for containers
**Duration**: 25-30 minutes per zone
**Critical timing**: 5:00-6:30 AM ONLY (never midday)

**Sprinkler automation**: 
- Program for Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday
- 5:30 AM start time  
- 25-30 minutes per zone
- **Manual override**: Skip if rain expected, add extra day if 100°F+

### **September-November (Peak Season Transition)**
**Strategy**: Garden recovery + heavy planting season
**Frequency**: 3 times per week
**Duration**: 20 minutes per zone
**Best times**: 6:00-7:00 AM

**Automation setting**:
- Program for Monday, Wednesday, Saturday
- 6:00 AM start time
- 20 minutes per zone

### **December-March (Peak Production Season)**
**Strategy**: Maximum productivity period with warm winters
**Frequency**: 2-3 times per week (more than traditional winter)
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes per zone
**Times**: 7:00-8:00 AM (later start in cool season)

**Warm winter reality**: More watering needed than traditional Zone 7 winters

## Heat-Adapted Crop Water Strategies

### **Extreme Heat Survivors (June-August)**
- **Okra**: Drought-tolerant, thrives with deep weekly watering
- **Peppers**: Established plants handle heat, consistent moisture for fruit set
- **Herbs**: Mediterranean types (oregano, thyme) very drought-tolerant
- **Containers**: Critical - check twice daily, may need daily watering

### **Peak Season Producers (October-April)**
- **Lettuce & Greens**: Consistent moisture critical for quality, less water than summer
- **Root vegetables**: Deep, less frequent watering develops strong roots
- **Beans**: Moderate water needs, avoid overwatering in cool weather
- **Succession crops**: Higher water needs during establishment, reduce as plants mature

### **Water-Intensive to Avoid in Heat**
- **Pak Choi**: Not worth the water cost during extreme heat
- **Traditional summer crops**: Most struggle with water efficiency in 100°F+

---

## Manual Override Situations

### Skip Automatic Watering When:
- **Rain forecast**: 0.5+ inches expected within 24 hours
- **Recent heavy rain**: Soil still moist from previous day's rain
- **Cool, cloudy weather**: Evaporation rates low
- **Fall/winter**: Soil stays moist longer

### Add Extra Watering When:
- **Heat wave**: Temperatures 90°F+ for multiple days
- **Windy conditions**: Increases evaporation
- **New plantings**: Seeds and transplants need extra moisture
- **Container plants**: Always check separately, dry out faster

---

## Soil Moisture Check

### Simple Test Methods:
1. **Finger test**: Stick finger 2-3 inches into soil
   - Moist = skip watering
   - Dry = water needed

2. **Visual cues**: 
   - Soil surface cracking = needs water
   - Plants wilting in morning = needs water
   - Mulch dry underneath = needs water

### Best Practice:
Check soil moisture every few days, even with automation running

## Seasonal Automation Programs

### Program 1: Summer (June-August)
- **Schedule**: M, W, F, Sun
- **Start time**: 6:00 AM
- **Duration**: 25 minutes each zone
- **Active months**: June, July, August

### Program 2: Spring/Fall (April-May, September-October)  
- **Schedule**: M, W, Sat
- **Start time**: 6:30 AM
- **Duration**: 20 minutes each zone
- **Active months**: April, May, September, October

### Program 3: Winter (November-March)
- **Use manual operation**: Check soil before watering
- **When needed**: 8:00 AM start
- **Duration**: 15 minutes each zone
- **Frequency**: 1-2 times per week maximum

---

## Container Considerations

### Containers Dry Faster:
- Check daily during hot weather
- May need hand watering between sprinkler cycles
- Morning check recommended

### Positioning for Sprinkler Coverage:
- Ensure containers are within sprinkler pattern
- Move containers if needed for better coverage
- Use drip trays to prevent water waste

---

## Water Conservation Tips

### Maximize Efficiency:
- **Mulch all beds**: Reduces evaporation by 50%+
- **Morning watering**: Less evaporation than midday
- **Deep, less frequent**: Encourages deep root growth
- **Skip when raining**: Don't waste water on wet soil

### Monitor and Adjust:
- Check system monthly for clogs or misaligned heads
- Adjust timing based on weather patterns
- Reduce frequency during cooler months

---

## Weather-Based Adjustments

### Hot & Dry Periods (90°F+):
- Increase frequency to daily if needed
- Extend duration by 5-10 minutes
- Check containers twice daily

### Rainy Periods:
- Turn off automation temporarily
- Resume 2-3 days after rain stops
- Check for overwatering signs (yellowing leaves)

### Seasonal Transitions:
- **Spring**: Gradually increase as temperatures rise
- **Fall**: Gradually decrease as temperatures drop
- **Winter**: Switch to manual, minimal watering

## Drip Irrigation Upgrade Plan

### **Phase 1 - October 2025 Installation** ($40-60)
- **Drip irrigation starter kit** for 1-2 beds
- **Install timing**: Best during fall when plants are establishing
- **Focus beds**: Start with most water-intensive areas
- **Benefits**: 50% water savings, better plant health, less disease

### **Phase 2 - February 2026 Expansion** ($40-80)  
- **Complete system coverage** for all beds
- **Integration**: Connect to existing sprinkler timer system
- **Container integration**: Drip lines for container plants
- **ROI**: Water savings + reduced labor + better yields

### **System Benefits for Heat-Adapted Garden**
- **Water efficiency**: Critical during 100°F+ heat waves
- **Disease prevention**: No wet foliage = fewer fungal problems
- **Consistent moisture**: Better for heat-stressed plants
- **Labor savings**: Less hand watering during extreme heat
- **Year-round value**: Efficient watering during peak production season

### **Economic Justification**
- **Initial cost**: $80-140 total system
- **Water savings**: 30-50% reduction in usage
- **Plant survival**: Better establishment during heat stress
- **Time savings**: Reduced daily hand-watering during summer
- **Value focus**: Infrastructure that reduces ongoing costs

This upgraded system provides efficient, heat-adapted irrigation for year-round production while minimizing water waste and labor during extreme weather.
