# Legacy Todo File - DEPRECATED

**This file has been restructured for better workflow automation:**

- **Active work** → `ACTIVE_WORK.md` (current priorities, next session prep)
- **Technical insights** → `LEARNINGS.md` (reusable patterns, cost discoveries)  
- **Process insights** → `DEV_LOG.md` (weekly workflow observations)
- **AI behavior** → `CLAUDE.md` (concise behavioral guide with auto-triggers)

**New workflow:** Documentation automatically updated after task completion with learning extraction triggers built into CLAUDE.md.

*This file preserved for reference but no longer actively maintained.*
